                <p>Among all the sacrifices made for you in the world, a mother does more than any soul. 
                    I couldn't even begin to fathom all sorts of ordeals that she goes through.

                <p>We were raised to believe all men are created equal. Equality in life and in its 
                    traits seem more of an illusion like the many lies we don't know are lies yet. 
                    Privilege exists in all levels of society, and we thought we had it hard.</p>

                    <p>A friend of mine once told me, "keep looking up, you never know what this world lets you witness. 
                        Stay hopeful". That's one thing I strongly believe still. True to effect, that's one code to live by
                         that one would likely not regret.</p>

                        <p>Royalty still exists today. What we mistake for equality is apparently economic saturation. 
                            I still long for a world without money and with tranquil. A dream revered, but seldom actually possible.
                            I wish I stay the day to watch it happen.
